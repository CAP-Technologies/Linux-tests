# Introduction to CAP Technologies Linux Tests

If you prefer reading over listening to podcasts, this is the short, readable introduction to our Linux testing series.

## Why this series exists
Linux is a practical alternative for many desktop and laptop users today. With more polished desktop experiences, broader community support, and lightweight options for older hardware, switching from Windows or macOS is easier than it used to be. This series documents hands‑on tests and guides aimed at people who are curious about making that move or who need to evaluate Linux for real‑world use.

## Who this is for
- Windows and macOS users considering a switch to Linux  
- Testers and contributors who want reproducible, shareable results  
- Anyone who wants clear, practical notes on installation, setup, and daily workflows

## What we test
Our focus is practical and user‑facing: clear, reproducible checks and guides that help a person decide whether a distro fits their needs. Typical coverage includes:
- Installation experience (Live USB, UEFI/Secure Boot)
- Initial setup and configuration (user accounts, software sources, common packages)
- Desktop environment usability and workflow notes
- Practical migration guidance and step‑by‑step instructions for common tasks

Each test includes exact steps, system information, and observations so results can be compared and reproduced.

## Example test machine
One of our baseline tests used a Dell Inspiron 3593 previously running Windows 10. It had 8 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7 CPU, and Intel Iris Plus graphics. This represents modest, older hardware many switchers still own — a realistic baseline for compatibility and usability testing.

## Single‑board computers and small form factors
We also include notes where a distro or workflow is especially relevant to small, affordable platforms (for example, recent Raspberry Pi models). These devices are useful for lightweight desktops, media tasks, and learning Linux; we’ll call out when a guide or test is applicable to them.

## Tone and approach
We test with real users in mind: straightforward notes, and pragmatic recommendations. Our goal is to show what works — not to promise perfection for every setup.

## Want to get involved?
Follow the series for in‑depth writeups and podcast episodes. If you’d like to contribute test results, scripts, or guides, check the repository for templates and a CONTRIBUTING.md. Try a Live USB or VM to reproduce tests, and open a pull request with your findings.

We hope these tests make evaluating Linux clearer and less intimidating. Give it a try and share your results!
