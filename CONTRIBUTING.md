# Contributing to Linux-tests

Thanks for helping improve this project — we keep things simple here. This repository shares practical, human-readable notes about trying Linux (especially for people moving from Windows or macOS). Contributions should be short, useful, and reproducible.

Quick start
- Read the README and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
- Search existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates.
- Keep changes small and focused.

What to contribute
- Short test notes or guides (what you tried, exact commands, distro + version, hardware).
- Migration tips or desktop workflow notes that helped you.
- Corrections or clarifications to existing content.
- Screenshots, logs, or checksums to help others reproduce results.

Issue template (short)
- Title: short summary + distro (e.g., "Wi‑Fi doesn't work — Ubuntu 24.04")
- Body:
  - Distro & version
  - Hardware or VM (e.g., Dell Inspiron 3593, Raspberry Pi 5, QEMU)
  - Steps you took (exact commands)
  - Expected vs actual result
  - Attach logs/screenshots if available

PRs and edits
- Fork → branch named type/short-description (e.g., docs/fix-readme-typo).
- Small PRs are easiest to review.
- In PR description include: what changed, why, and how to verify.
- No heavy CI or large binaries — link to external artifacts if needed.

Style
- Be explicit: exact commands, exact distro versions, and any image checksums.
- Keep language clear and approachable for people switching from Windows/macOS.
- Avoid destructive defaults (document them clearly if unavoidable).

Reporting problems & code of conduct
- Follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for reporting and behavior expectations.
- Don’t post secrets or private data in issues/PRs.

License
- By contributing you agree to license your changes under this repository’s license. See LICENSE for details.

Thanks — short, reproducible contributions are the most helpful. If you want, I can add this CONTRIBUTING.md to the repository for you.
