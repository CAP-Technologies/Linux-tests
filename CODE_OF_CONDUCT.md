# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming project environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this repository and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful and constructive in discussions and reviews
- Showing patience when onboarding or helping newcomers
- Giving and receiving feedback gracefully

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory remarks in any form
- Personal insults, sustained disruption of discussions, or threats
- Publishing others' private information (doxing) without consent
- Sexual language, unwanted advances, or inappropriate physical contact
- Retaliation against someone for reporting unacceptable behavior

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and activities, including:
- GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments
- Project discussion channels (chat, mailing lists, forums)
- Events related to the project (meetups, conferences, workshops)
- Any other public or private communications made on behalf of the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at:
- Public: open a new issue labeled `conduct` (if the report is not sensitive)
- Private/sensitive reports: email maintainers at oprl53n2s@mozmail.com or use GitHub's private reporting features

All reports will be handled with discretion and treated seriously. When a report is received, the maintainers will:
1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within a reasonable timeframe.
2. Evaluate the report and, when necessary, collect additional context.
3. Take appropriate and proportional corrective action, which may include:
   - A private warning to the offender
   - Temporary or permanent removal from project access
   - Public or private apologies and remediation steps
4. Communicate outcomes to the reporter where appropriate and feasible.

Retaliation against anyone who reports misconduct in good faith will not be tolerated.

## Reporting Guidelines

When reporting behavior, please include:
- A description of the incident, with time, date, and location (URL or context)
- Copies of any relevant communications (comments, emails, logs)
- The names or GitHub handles of those involved, if known
- Whether you would like the report to remain confidential

If you are unsure whether an incident constitutes a violation, please still report it. Maintainers will help determine the appropriate next steps.

## Roles & Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Enforcing this Code of Conduct fairly and consistently
- Responding to reports in a timely manner
- Updating this document and enforcement process as necessary

Contributors are responsible for:
- Following the standards outlined in this document

## Scope of Penalties

Consequences for violating the Code of Conduct will be proportional to the severity and frequency of the behavior and may include:
- A private warning
- Removal of privileges (e.g., inability to merge or commit)
- Removal from project membership
- Temporary or permanent banning from project platforms
- Public notification of actions taken, where appropriate

## Appeals

If you are the subject of enforcement action and wish to appeal, please contact the maintainers via the same private channel used for reporting. Appeals will be reviewed by at least two maintainers who were not involved in the original decision.

## Attribution
